# Braingeneers Device Viewer and Message Sender

This is a simple web application that allows you to view the data from a Braingeneers device and send messages to it.

It is intended to function as a connectivity test for the braingeneers shadow database and the EMQX message broker.

It can also serve as a template for more sophisticated device control applications.
